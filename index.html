    <p>Coconut Oil isn’t just for cooking. Did you know that you can also swap out some of your beauty products in place of it! I’ve already made the switch, and I can officially call myself a coconut enthusiast. You can use coconut oil to hydrate & moisturize the skin, for hair care, and as a makeup remover. I also use it in my health and weight-loss efforts. Below is a list of its many uses!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Hair Conditioner</li>
        <li>Body oil</li>
        <li>Lip Balm</li>
        <li>Under Eye Cream</li>
        <li>Frizz Control</li>
        <li>Make-up Remover</li>
